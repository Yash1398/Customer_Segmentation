# Customer_Segmentation

### Intro 
Imagine walking into your favorite clothing store and being greeted by a salesperson who knows your name, your style, and your size. They show you a selection of clothes that are perfect for you and even suggest some new items that you might like. You leave the store feeling happy and satisfied with your purchases.

This personalized shopping experience is made possible by customer segmentation. By analyzing customer data, the store is able to group its customers into different segments based on their preferences and behaviors. This allows the store to tailor its products and marketing efforts to meet the specific needs of each customer segment. As a result, customers feel understood and valued, and the store is able to increase its sales and customer loyalty.

### Objective 
In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database.

### Data
This dataset contains information about customers, including their unique ID, birth year, education level, marital status, yearly household income, number of children and teenagers in their household, date of enrollment with the company, number of days since their last purchase, and whether they have complained in the last 2 years.

It also includes information about the products they have purchased, including the amount spent on wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold in the last 2 years. The dataset also contains information about promotions, including the number of purchases made with a discount and whether the customer accepted offers in various campaigns.

In addition, the dataset includes information about the customer’s purchasing behavior, such as the number of purchases made through the company’s website, using a catalogue or directly in stores, and the number of visits to the company’s website in the last month.

The goal is to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.
